/**
	A Smart Pointer template class. This is similar to the Standard
	Library auto_ptr class, except with one or two useability
	enhancements.  An instance of a smart pointer encapsulates a
	pointer to some other type and manages deallocation, for example:
	&lt;pre&gt;
	void ofn ( Object * );

	void fn()
	{
		SmartPointer&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; p = new Object ("Whatever");
		p-&gt;method();

		ofn ( p );
	}
	&lt;/pre&gt;
	The dynamically-allocated instance of Object will be deallocated
	by the destructor for p.
&lt;p&gt;
	SmartPointer has ownership-transfer semantics for copies, which
	doesn't work for every possible situation, but well enough most of
	the time. For situations where it isn't good enough (like multi-threading)
	see RefCount, which does full reference counting.
&lt;p&gt;
	If you see a 'multiple assignment operator' warning. Don't
	worry about it, there are supposed to be multiple assignment
	operators. Three, to be precise.

	&lt;/pre&gt;
	on compilers that treat string constants as char *, not as const
	char * as they should (IMNSHO, anyway).  What happens then is that
	when the ptr object goes out of scope, the destructor will attempt
	to delete[] an area of memory that's in the constant data segment.
	With corresponding error messages and chokings from the OS.
