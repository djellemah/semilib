This package contains some c++ classes I've written along the
way to make things easier. They're aimed at coder-friendliness
in other words they should make things easier for a programmer.

regex

contains a Regex class to wrap up the POSIX regex calls.

utils

various stuff

fuzzymatch

contains Soundex and NGram (fuzzy match) classes

Building

The usual.

./configure
make
make install

default prefix for configure is /usr/local/semiosix

--with-boost allows you to specify that the boost regex library should
be used rather than the system regex. Boost is at http://www.boost.org
